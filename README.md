# Pulse
My entry for the Swift Student Challenge 2023.

> **Notice:** You'll need to run this playground on an M1 machine or better, it won't work on lower-end iPads or old Macs as it's not well-optimised.

Pulse is a playground for estimating your heart rate using your camera.

It uses:
- **AVFoundation** for capturing video from your device's front camera.
- **Core Image** for cropping and elaborating frames.
- **Vision** for detecting your face and tracking it over time.
- **Accelerate** to perform FFTs and other vector-related and statistical operations.
- **SwiftUI** for the user interface.
